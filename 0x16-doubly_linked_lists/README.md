# 0x16. C - Doubly linked lists
ow-level programming & Algorithm â€• Data structures and Algorithms

## Purpose
To learn how to print, insert, delete, and find a node in double linked list

## Coding style
- All C files are compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and using [Betty Style](https://\github.com/holbertonschool/Betty) for checking coding and documentation styles.

## Getting started
To use, first download  this repository into your local machine by issuing the following command in your local terminal. 
```
git clone https://github.com/sumin3/holbertonschool-low_level_programming.git
```
#### Directory
Each directoy's name includes information below
1. a number which orders projects from beginning to advanced level
2. name of programming language
3. concept/topic.
#### Change Directory
```
cd 0x16-doubly_linked_lists
```
After change current working directory to **0x16-doubly_linked_lists** directory, issue the following command to compile

* Run .c file

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <filename.c> -o <output filename>
```
Once the .c files are compiled you can run the program by issuing the command
```
./<output filename>
```

## Usage Examples
```
$./b
-> 2 elements
```

## Files
Task number | File | Desc

1  | 1-dlistint_len.c  |returns the number of elements in a linked dlistint_t list.
2  | 2-add_dnodeint.c | adds a new node at the beginning of a dlistint_t list.
3  | 3-add_dnodeint_end.c |adds a new node at the end of a dlistint_t list.
4  | 4-free_dlistint.c |free a dlistint_t list.
5  | 5-get_dnodeint.c | returns the nth node of a dlistint_t linked list.
6  | 6-sum_dlistint.c | returns the sum of all the data (n) of a dlistint_t linked list.
7  | 7-insert_dnodeint.c |inserts a new node at a given position.
8  | 8-delete_dnodeint.c |deletes the node at index index of a dlistint_t linked list.
