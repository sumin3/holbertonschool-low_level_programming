# 0x0E. C - Function pointers
Low-level programming & Algorithm â€• Hatching out

## Purpose
- To learn what are function pointers and how to use them

## Coding style
- All C files are compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and using [Betty Style](https://\github.com/holbertonschool/Betty) for checking coding and documentation styles.

## Getting started
To use, first download  this repository into your local machine by issuing the following command in your local terminal. 
```
git clone https://github.com/sumin3/holbertonschool-low_level_programming.git
```
#### Directory
Each directoy's name includes information below
1. a number which orders projects from beginning to advanced level
2. name of programming language
3. concept/topic.
#### Change Directory
```
cd 0x0E-function_pointers
```
After change current working directory to **0x0E-function_pointers** directory, issue the following command to compile

* Run .c file
```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <filename.c> -o <output filename>
```
Once the .c files are compiled you can run the program by issuing the command
```
./<output filename>
```

## Usage Examples
```
$ ./a 
1
5
0
98
402
```
## Files

1 | 1-array_iterator.c, *1-main.c* | executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array.
2 | 2-int_index.c, *2-main.c* |  searches for an integer.
3 | 3-main.c, 3-op_functions.c, 3-get_op_func.c, 3-calc.h | Write a program that performs simple operations.
