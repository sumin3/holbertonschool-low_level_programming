# 0x13. C - Bit manipulation
Low-level programming & Algorithm â€• Hatching out

## Purpose
To learn how to manipulate bits and use bitwise operators

## Coding style
- All C files are compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and using [Betty Style](https://\github.com/holbertonschool/Betty) for checking coding and documentation styles.

## Getting started
To use, first download  this repository into your local machine by issuing the following command in your local terminal. 
```
git clone https://github.com/sumin3/holbertonschool-low_level_programming.git
```
#### Directory
Each directoy's name includes information below
1. a number which orders projects from beginning to advanced level
2. name of programming language
3. concept/topic.
#### Change Directory
```
cd 0x13. C - Bit manipulation
```
After change current working directory to **0x13. C - Bit manipulation** directory, issue the following command to compile

* Run .c file
```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <filename.c> -o <output filename>
```
Once the .c files are compiled you can run the program by issuing the command
```
./<output filename>
```

## Usage Examples
```
$ ./a 
1
5
0
98
402
```

1 | 1-print_binary.c, *1-main.c* | prints the binary representation of a number.
2 | 2-get_bit.c, *2-main.c* | returns the value of a bit at a given index.
3 | 3-set_bit.c, *3-main.c* | sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.
4 | 4-clear_bit.c, *4-main.c* | sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.
5 | 5-flip_bits.c, *5-main.c* | returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.
6 | 100-get_endianness.c, *100-main.c* | checks the endianness.
