# 0x18. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO
Low-level programming & Algorithm â€• Data structures and Algorithms

## Goal
To create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files

## Purpose
- To learn what are stack and queue, and how to use them
- To learn the common implementations if stacks and queues
- To learn the most common use cases of stacks and queues
- To learn what do LIFO and FIFO
- To learn how to use global variables properly
- To learn how to work with git submodules

## Coding style
- All C files are compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and using [Betty Style](https://\github.com/holbertonschool/Betty) for checking coding and documentation styles.

## Getting started
To use, first download  this repository into your local machine by issuing the following command in your local terminal. 
```
git clone https://github.com/sumin3/monty.git
```
#### Directory
Each directoy's name includes information below
1. a number which orders projects from beginning to advanced level
2. name of programming language
3. concept/topic.
#### Change Directory
```
cd monty
```
After change current working directory to **monty** directory, issue the following command to compile

* Run .c file
```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <filename.c> -o <output filename>
```
Once the .c files are compiled you can run the program by issuing the command
```
./<output filename> <Monty ByteCodes file>
```

## Usage Examples
```
$cat 00.m
push 1
push 2
push 3
pall
swap
pall
$ ./monty 00.m
3
2
1
2
3
1
```

## Opcode
Opcode | Desc
---|---
push | pushes an element to the stack.
pall | prints all the values on the stack
pint | prints the value at the top of the stack, followed by a new line.
pop | removes the top element of the stack.
swap | swap the first two element of the stack.
add | adds the top two elements of the stack.
nop | do nothing
sub | subtracts the top element of the stack from the second top element
div | divides the second top element of the stack by the top element of the stack.
mul | multiplies the second top element of the stack with the top element of the stack.
mod | computes the rest of the division of the second top element of the stack by the top element of the stack
pchar | prints the char at the top of the stack, followed by a new line.
pstr | prints the string starting at the top of the stack, followed by a new line.
rotl | rotates the stack to the top.
rotr | rotates the stack to the bottom.
