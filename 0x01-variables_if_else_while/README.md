## Purpose
- To learn How to use the if, if ... else statements
- To learn What are the logical operators (sometimes called boolean operators) and how to use them
- To learn What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them
- To learn What the the relational operators and how to use them
- To learn What values are considered TRUE and FALSE in C
- To learn What is the ASCII character set

## Coding style
- All C files are compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and using [Betty Style](https://\github.com/holbertonschool/Betty) for checking coding and documentation styles.

## Installation
To use, first download  this repository into your local machine by issuing the following command in your local terminal. 
```
git clone https://github.com/sumin3/holbertonschool-low_level_programming.git
```

#### Change Directory
```
cd 0x01-variables_if_else_while
```

## Usage
```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <filename.c> -o <output filename>
```
Once the .c files are compiled you can run the program by issuing the command
```
./<output filename>
```

### Usage Example
```
$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra 1-main.c 1-last_digit.c -o 1-isdigit
$ ./1-isdigit 
0: 1
a: 0
```
