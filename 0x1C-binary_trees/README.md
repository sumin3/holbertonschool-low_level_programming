## Purpose
- To learn What is a binary tree
- To learn What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
- To learn What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
- To learn What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree

## Coding style
- All C files are compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and using [Betty Style](https://\github.com/holbertonschool/Betty) for checking coding and documentation styles.

## Installation
To use, first download  this repository into your local machine by issuing the following command in your local terminal. 
```
git clone https://github.com/sumin3/holbertonschool-low_level_programming.git
```
#### Directory
Each directoy's name includes information below
1. a number which orders projects from beginning to advanced level
2. name of programming language
3. concept/topic.
#### Change Directory
```
cd 0x1C-binary_trees
```

## Usage
```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <filename.c> -o <output filename>
```
Once the .c files are compiled you can run the program by issuing the command
```
./<output filename>
```

### Usage Example
```
$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra 1-main.c 1-isdigit.c -o 1-isdigit
$ ./1-isdigit 
0: 1
a: 0
```
