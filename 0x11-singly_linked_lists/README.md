# 0x11. C - Singly linked lists
Low-level programming & Algorithm â€• Data structures and Algorithms

## Purpose
To learn how to build and use linked lists. 

## Coding style
- All C files are compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and using [Betty Style](https://\github.com/holbertonschool/Betty) for checking coding and documentation styles.

## Getting started
To use, first download  this repository into your local machine by issuing the following command in your local terminal. 
```
git clone https://github.com/sumin3/holbertonschool-low_level_programming.git
```
#### Directory
Each directoy's name includes information below
1. a number which orders projects from beginning to advanced level
2. name of programming language
3. concept/topic.
#### Change Directory
```
cd 0x11-singly_linked_lists
```
After change current working directory to **0x11-singly_linked_lists** directory, issue the following command to compile

* Run .c file
```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <filename.c> -o <output filename>
```
Once the .c files are compiled you can run the program by issuing the command
```
./<output filename>
```

## Usage Examples
```
$ ./a 
1
5
0
98
402
```
## Files
Task number | File | Desc
---|--|---
0 | 0-print_list.c, *0-main.c* | prints all the elements of a list_t list.
1 | 1-list_len.c, *1-main.c* | returns the number of elements in a linked list_t list.
2 | 2-add_node.c, *2-main.c* | adds a new node at the beginning of a list_t list.
3 | 3-add_node_end.c, *3-main.c* | adds a new node at the end of a list_t list.
4 | 4-free_list.c, *4-main.c* | frees a list_t list.
5 | 100-first.c, *100-main.c* | Write a function that prints You're beat! and yet, you must allow,\nI bore my house upon my back!\n before the main function is executed.
6 | 101-hello_holberton.asm | Write a 64-bit program in assembly that prints Hello, Holberton, followed by a new line.

* All main.c files in *Italic characters* and header file - *lists.h* are provided by [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com/)
