## Purpose
- To learn How to print text using printf, puts and putchar
- To learn How to get the size of a specific type using the unary operator sizeof
- To learn How to compile using gcc
- To learn How does the main function influence the return value of the program

## Coding style
- All C files are compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and using [Betty Style](https://\github.com/holbertonschool/Betty) for checking coding and documentation styles.

## Installation
To use, first download  this repository into your local machine by issuing the following command in your local terminal. 
```
git clone https://github.com/sumin3/holbertonschool-low_level_programming.git
```

#### Change Directory
```
cd 0x00-hello_world
```

## Usage
```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <filename.c> -o <output filename>
```
Once the .c files are compiled you can run the program by issuing the command
```
./<output filename>
```

### Usage Example
```
$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra 1-main.c 1-compiler -o 1-isdigit
$ ./1-isdigit 
0: 1
a: 0
```
