# 0x07. C - Recursion
Low-level programming & Algorithm â€• Hatching out

## Purpose
- To learn What is recursion, and how to use it

## Coding style
- All C files are compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and using [Betty Style](https://\github.com/holbertonschool/Betty) for checking coding and documentation styles.

## Getting started
To use, first download  this repository into your local machine by issuing the following command in your local terminal. 
```
git clone https://github.com/sumin3/holbertonschool-low_level_programming.git
```
#### Directory
Each directoy's name includes information below
1. a number which orders projects from beginning to advanced level
2. name of programming language
3. concept/topic.
#### Change Directory
```
cd 0x07-recursion
```
After change current working directory to **0x07-recursion** directory, issue the following command to compile

* Run .c file
```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <filename.c> -o <output filename>
```
Once the .c files are compiled you can run the program by issuing the command
```
./<output filename>
```

## Usage Examples
```
$ ./a 
1
5
0
98
402
```

2 | 2-strlen_recursion.c, *2-main.c* | returns the length of a string.
3 | 3-factorial.c, *3-main.c* | returns the factorial of a given number.
4 | 4-pow_recursion.c, *4-main.c* | returns the value of x raised to the power of y.
5 | 5-sqrt_recursion.c, *5-main.c* | returns the natural square root of a number.
6 | 6-is_prime_number.c, *6-main.c* | returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0.
7 | 7-is_palindrome.c, *7-main.c* | returns 1 if a string is a palindrome and 0 if not.
